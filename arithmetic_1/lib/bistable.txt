(* The standard defines the SR FB thus: 

                  +-----+
S1----------------| >=1 |---Q1
         +---+    |     |
 R------O| & |----|     |
 Q1------|   |    |     |
         +---+    +-----+
*)

FUNCTION_BLOCK SR
  VAR_INPUT
    S1, R : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  VAR_OUTPUT
    Q1 : BOOL;
  END_VAR
  Q1 := S1 OR ((NOT R) AND Q1);
END_FUNCTION_BLOCK


(* The standard defines the RS FB thus: 
                   +---+
R1----------------O| & |---Q1
        +-----+    |   |
S-------| >=1 |----|   |
Q1------|     |    |   |
        +-----+    +---+
*)
